# learningPythonClasses
A foundation project to explore creating and calling classes and class instances

I will be adding examples as I complete them here is a breakdown of the files used so far:

There is a single class which will be called by each of the exmaple files. The class is used to create a car.
Example1 - Creates my_car and your_car by calling the class with different vehicle make, model, registration and mileage.
